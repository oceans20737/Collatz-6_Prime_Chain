6-adic Collatz Prime Chains
===========================

A research project exploring rare prime number sequences generated by a 6-adic Collatz-like transformation:

f(n) = (7n + k) / 6,  where k ∈ {−1, −5, +5, +1}

The constant k is selected based on n mod 12 to ensure the result is an integer and remains odd.
This parity-preserving method avoids even-number traps and enables the discovery of long prime chains.

Overview

While the classical Collatz conjecture focuses on convergence, this project investigates a 6-adic transformation that produces strictly increasing sequences of odd primes.

By applying a modular rule to select k ∈ {±1, ±5}, we ensure that the numerator (7n + k) is divisible by 6 and remains even.
This approach significantly increases the survival rate of prime chains under geometric expansion.

A continuous search over odd integers below 10,000,000 led to the discovery of nine length-7 prime chains and one length-8 chain.

Discovered Length-8 Chain

The following chain satisfies:

p(i+1) = (7 * p(i) + k) / 6

with k chosen to ensure divisibility and parity preservation.

Chain (n₀ = 1,099,687):

1,099,687
1,282,969
1,496,797
1,746,263
2,037,307
2,376,859
2,773,003
3,235,171

All values were verified prime using deterministic primality testing.

Mathematical Notes

6-adic branching logic:

If n ≡ 1 (mod 12):   f(n) = (7n − 1) / 6
If n ≡ 5 (mod 12):   f(n) = (7n − 5) / 6
If n ≡ 7 (mod 12):   f(n) = (7n + 5) / 6
If n ≡ 11 (mod 12):  f(n) = (7n + 1) / 6

This ensures integer outputs and maintains odd parity throughout the chain.

Parity Preservation:

By choosing k ∈ {±1, ±5}, the numerator (7n + k) remains even for all odd n, ensuring the result is an odd integer and avoiding even-number traps.
